In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

I decided to complete the freeCodeCamp responsive web design and give it a try. it's one of the best coding websites you can learn how to code self-start. I am glad if this project will help you as a refference for your project.  always code code and practice even if you find a completed project.
